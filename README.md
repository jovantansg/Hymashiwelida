  Hello! I'm Jovan!
</h1>

<p>
  A little bit about myself - From a young age, I found my calling in helping others - from small, everyday things like offering a listening ear to a friend in need or sharing an umbrella with a stranger, to (slightly) bigger things like tutoring children from less-privileged families or volunteering to help renovate houses. Naturally, as I grew up, I leaned towards pursuing a career in emergency services (SCDF in my country) or healthcare, but certain circumstances have prevented me from doing so.

  Thankfully, while pursuing a degree in human resources (which I saw as a way to help people in the corporate world), I discovered a passion for data and analytics. Since graduation in late 2023, I've been working as a business analyst in the retail sector. However, I've since realized that it was possible to marry my original career aspirations in healthcare/emergency services with data, and so I started building a data analytics portfolio here in GitHub. My goal is to get opportunities to work in either of the two sectors and help people with data analytics and by developing visualizations with insights that can save lives, for doctors, nurses, and/or emergency services personnel on the ground.

  I hope you'll enjoy my projects as you scroll! Please reach out to me if you're interested in anything I've worked on, or if you're simply looking to exchange tips. If nothing, I'd have gained a new friend :)
